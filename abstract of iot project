INDRODUCTION:
              air pollution monitor system is a process that monitor and quality of the air in relation to pollutants and toxins
PROBLEM:
            < long term health diseases
            < lung cancer
            < respiratory diseases
            < diseases such as emphysema
            < cause damage to people's 
                    * nerves
                    * brain
                    * kidneys
                    * liver & other organs
COMPONENDS:
                   < arduino uno
                   < AQI pm 2.5
                   < LCD
                   < connecting wires
< Techinique used in our project is using pm(particulate matter)

JUSTIFICATION:
              < on using this air pollution monitor we get to know how much the air is contaminated
              < by knowing that we can follow the safety measures
